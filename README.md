Compromised EC2 Running Jenkins: Vulnerability Detection and Remediation Using AWS Inspector and NIST CVSS


##Objective:


This project demonstrates how to identify, analyze, and remediate vulnerabilities in a compromised EC2 instance running Jenkins using AWS Inspector and the NIST Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) framework. The EC2 instance will be deliberately configured with insecure settings and vulnerable Jenkins installations, allowing AWS Inspector to detect the flaws, which will then be analyzed using the NIST CVSS framework for remediation.

## Launch EC2 Instance with Jenkins
Spin up an EC2 instance using an Ubuntu AMI.

Instance Type: Choose a small instance such as t2.micro (for testing purposes).

Security Group: Open ports 22 (SSH) and 8080 (Jenkins), and other relevant ports for Jenkins.

Install Jenkins on the EC2 instance: Use the following user data script to install Jenkins and set it up with intentionally insecure configurations:

##  AWS Inspector Configuration

#Set Up Amazon Inspector

Enable AWS Inspector: Go to Amazon Inspector in the AWS Console and enable it for EC2 Instances. Ensure that the compromised Jenkins instance is included in the assessment targets.

Set Up an Assessment Template: Configure continuous vulnerability assessments to detect potential risks associated with the EC2 instance, particularly those related to Jenkins and its configuration.

## Vulnerability Scoring with NIST CVSS:
Each vulnerability identified by AWS Inspector will be scored using the NIST CVSS framework. Here are a few examples:

##  Remediation of Vulnerabilities


# Enforce Authentication for Jenkins

Issue: Jenkins is running without authentication, allowing anyone to access it.
Remediation: Enable security by editing the config.xml to require authentication and use role-based access control (RBAC).
# Run Jenkins as a Non-Root User


Issue: Jenkins is running with root privileges, which exposes the instance to privilege escalation attacks.
Remediation: Configure Jenkins to run under a non-privileged user (jenkins by default) to limit the potential impact of a compromise.
# Enable SSL for Jenkins


Issue: Jenkins is running without SSL, leaving it vulnerable to eavesdropping.
Remediation: Set up SSL certificates (e.g., using Letâ€™s Encrypt) and configure Jenkins to use HTTPS.
#  Apply Security Patches


Issue: Missing patches on the Ubuntu instance could introduce vulnerabilities.
Remediation: Regularly update the OS using sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade to ensure all patches are applied.
